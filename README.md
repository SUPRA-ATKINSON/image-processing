***below are the lab experiments corresponding to each file(ex: lab-1, lab-2) respectively*
*written in Matlab***

**Lab Experiment 1:**

**Lab Experiment 3:**
Develop programs for following intensity transformation operation on a grayscale image. Collect any gray scale image from any source. Process that image using these operations.
a. Image negative 
b. Log transformation and inverse log transform: s = c log (1+r), c is a const, r â‰¥ 0. s is pixel intensity of output image, r is the pixel intensity of input image. Study the effect of constant c on the quality of output image.

d. Max filtering 
e. Min filtering 


**Lab Experiment 5:**
Take a grayscale image and add salt and pepper noise. Write programs for following operations and observe their outputs 
a. Linear smoothing or Image averaging 
b. Weighted averaging 
c. Median filtering. Compare the output quality among Image averaging and median filtering.

e. Min filtering  


Lab Experiment 6:

a. Laplacian filter 
b. Filtering using composite mask 
c. Unsharp masking 
d. High boost filtering 
e. Filtering using first order derivative operators such as sobel and prewitt mask.


Lab Experiment 7:
Write a program to improve contrast of an image using histogram equalization. The prototype of the function is as below: histogram_equalisation(input_Image, no_of_bins); The function should return the enhanced image. Consider two low contrast input images. Study the nature of the output image quality in each case by varying the number of bins.
Lab Experiment 8:
Take a low contrast grayscale image (A) and a high contrast gray scale image (B). Write a program to improve the contrast of A with the help of image B using histogram specification or matching. The prototype of the function is as below: Histogram_sp(input_Image, specified_Iage, no_of_bins); The function should return the enhanced image.


Lab Experiment 9:

a. Compare/comment on the output of Ideal, Butterworth and Gaussian Low pass Filters having the same radii (cutoff frequency) value.
b. Consider a suitable gray scale image and demonstrate the ringing effect on the output of Ideal low pass frequency domain filter. 
c. Compare the output of Butterworth low pass filters (order n=2) for different cutoff frequencies (5, 15, 30, 90, 120). 
d. Compare the output of Gaussian low pass filters for different cut-off frequencies (5, 15, 30, 90, and 120).
